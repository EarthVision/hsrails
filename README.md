# hsrails
### high speed rails

A spigot plugin to make rails great again.

Place a powered rail on a redstone block to build high speed rail.
Default speed is 4x regular powered rails, ie. 32 m/s, or 115 km/h. This is as fast as rocket powered elytra flight.

The high speed multiplier can be changed with the `/hsrails` command.
